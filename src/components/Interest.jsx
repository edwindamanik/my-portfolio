      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>
        I have a high interest in building a website software using javascript
        technology, namely React. I also have interest in building a mobile app
        using flutter or react native. <br />
        <br /> Apart from building an app, I also have interest in playing
        football and also playing football games. I also like to play music like
        the guitar with the genre of pop songs and songs that can relax the mind
      </p>
    </div>
